‚úÖ **Create an itinerary**  
‚úÖ **Retrieve an itinerary by user ID**  

Now, I'll provide the **best-practice repository structure** for this project. Stay tuned! üéØ

üìå **Repository Structure Best Practices Added!**  
Your **GraphQL Itinerary Service** now includes a well-structured folder layout:  

```
/src
  /graphql
    - schema.graphql
    - resolvers.js
    - typeDefs.js
  /services
    - itineraryService.js
  /database
    - db.js
/tests
  - itinerary.test.js
index.js

## State Management

Editor‚Äôs Note: State management libraries can be great, but often aren‚Äôt necessary. tRPC‚Äôs React Query hooks should be able to take care of your server state. For client state, start with React‚Äôs useState, and reach for one of these options when you need more.

### Zustand
For never using Redux again

The ‚Äúmodern, simple Redux‚Äù you didn‚Äôt know you needed. Poimandres‚Üó can always be trusted. You can build everything from video call apps to games to servers with this little library.

Zustand Homepage‚Üó
Zustand GitHub‚Üó


### Jotai
For never using Context again

For a more atomic approach, Jotai is hard to beat. Also by Poimandres‚Üó, Jotai lets you define singletons that feel like global useState. A great option for stateful behaviors that don‚Äôt need a state machine just yet.

## Unstyled Component Libraries
Also known as headless libraries, they provide great unstyled, and accessible components that you can customize to your liking. Here are a few recommendations.

Radix UI‚Üó gives you a powerful set of convenient and accessible primitives that you can style with vanilla or Tailwind CSS.

Headless UI‚Üó made by the Tailwind CSS team also provides unstyled, accessible components that integrate seamlessly with Tailwind CSS.

React Aria‚Üó provides accessible UI primitives for your design system. Their Date Picker component is top tier.
